# clustering
During my time in undergrad at the University of Central Arkansas, I was apart of the 4+1 program. I was able to take a graduate level clustering class. In this repository you will find the datasets and solutions to those problems. This class was online and had very little instructions which made it a very great opportunity to learn.
